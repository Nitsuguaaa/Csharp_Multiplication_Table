# Csharp_Multiplication_Table
A simple multiplication table using arrays in c#

I'm a student learning C# programming so the code might and will be rusty.
If you're a student who just happens to see this code that matches your activity. I encourage you to try and learn how the code works so that in your future programs you won't be searching for code that you've already done <3
